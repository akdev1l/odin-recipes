    <h1>Decadent Flourless Chocolate Cake</h1>
    <img src="../images/chocolate-cake.jpeg" alt="Great Dessert - Flourless Chocolate Cake in Raspberry Sauce">
<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This 'flourless' chocolate cake was all the rage in the 1980s. As I vaguely remember, the decade celebrated decadent overindulgence and this dessert is that and more. By modern standards, this cake is ridiculously rich. In fact, some of you may find it too intense, but most true chocolate fiends will be in heaven. Serve with ice-cold fresh raspberry sauce.</p>

        <li>Melt semisweet chocolate and unsalted butter together in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula, until chocolate and butter are completely melted and combined. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl with a whisk or an electric mixer until pale and very thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Sift in flour, cayenne, and salt; whisk to combine.</li>
