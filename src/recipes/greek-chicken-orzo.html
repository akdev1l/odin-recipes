<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your cooking tools and then start the recipe.  Read the entire recipe card. Wash and dry all produce. Cut onion into Â½-inch pieces. Zest and juice half the lemon. Cut remaining lemon into wedges. Roughly chop baby spinach. Grate or mince garlic.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towel. Season with salt, pepper, and Mediterranean Spice Blend. In a large non-stick pan, heat 2 tsp oil (double for 4 portions) over medium-high heat, until hot. Add chicken. Sear, until golden, 1-2 min per side. Set chicken aside on a plate (NOTE: Chicken will finish cooking in step 4!)</li>
        <li>In the same pan, reduce heat to medium, then add 1 tsp oil (double for 4 portions). Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 2-3 minutes. Add orzo and garlic. Cook for 30 sec, until garlic is fragrant. Add 2 cups of warm water, 1/4 tsp salt (double both for 4 portions) and chicken broth. Bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce heat to medium. Nestle chicken into pan. Cook, stirring occasionally for 8-10 min, flipping chicken halfway through, until chicken is cooked through.**Transfer chicken to a clean cutting board.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until orzo is tender and the broth is almost entirely absorbed. (NOTE: For 4 portions, if orzo is still too brothy, increase heat and continue cooking, stirring often, until liquid is almost absorbed.)Stir spinach into pan until wilted, 1 minute. Remove pan from heat and stir in lemon zest, 1 tbsp lemon juice*, and 2 tbsp butter (double both for 4 portions).Season with salt and pepper. Thinly slice the chicken.</li>
        <li>Plate orzotto with chicken over top. Sprinkle with feta. Squeeze over a lemon wedge, to taste. Enjoy!</li>
